// Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. 
// You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

// Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, 
// or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

// The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called higher order functions.

// When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a lambda.


// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the

a specific type of tea).
