# MyfreeCodeCamper
This is the first repository Martin has made for taking online programming courses.

1.) Martin's first course from freeCodeCamp (fCC) is on Responsive Web Design.

2.) Martin followed it up with a Django Web App Tutorial by Coding with Tomi published by fCC.

3.) Martin then went to double-down on the Front-End Dev with fCC's Front End Development Libraries Course.
