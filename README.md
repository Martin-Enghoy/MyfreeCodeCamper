# MyfreeCodeCamper
This is the first repository Martin has made for taking online programming courses.

1.) Martin's first course from freeCodeCamp (fCC) is on Responsive Web Design.

2.) Martin followed it up with a Django Web App Tutorial by Coding with Tomi published by fCC.

3.) Martin then went to double-down on the Front-End Dev with fCC's Front End Development Libraries Course.

4.) As Martin went into the Front-end focus of things, he also worked on his javaScript knowledge with fCC's javaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Course.

5.) Aside from the Front-end, Martin will be working on the automation part of their Thesis which runs the entire IoT of the Raspi. 
    He worked on his Python by taking the Intermediate Python Programming Course from fCC first. (https://youtu.be/HGOBQPFzWKo)
