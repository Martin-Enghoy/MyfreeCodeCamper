<!--
    Low contrast between the foreground and background colors can make text difficult to read. 
    Sufficient contrast improves your content's readability, but what exactly does "sufficient" mean?

    The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal text. 
    The ratio is calculated by comparing the relative luminance values of two colors. This ranges from 1:1 for the same color, 
    or no contrast, to 21:1 for white against black, the most substantial contrast. There are many contrast checking tools available online that calculate this ratio for you.

        <h2>A Word on the Recent Catnip Doping Scandal</h2>
        <p>The influence that catnip has on feline behavior is well-documented, and its use as an herbal supplement in
            competitive ninja circles remains controversial. Once again, the debate to ban the substance is brought to
            the public's attention after the high-profile win of Kittytron, a long-time proponent and user of the green
            stuff, at the Claw of Fury tournament.</p>
        <p>As I've stated in the past, I firmly believe a true ninja's skills must come from within, with no external
            influences. My own catnip use shall continue as purely recreational.</p>

        <p>The internet is littered with varying opinions on nutritional paradigms, from catnip paleo to hairball
            cleanses. But let's turn our attention to an often overlooked fitness fuel, and examine the protein-carb-NOM
            trifecta that is lasagna...</p>

        <h2><a accesskey="c" id="second" href="#">Is Chuck Norris a Cat Person?</a></h2>


        <p>Chuck Norris is widely regarded as the premier martial artist on the planet, and it's a complete coincidence
            that anyone who disagrees with this fact mysteriously disappears soon after. But the real question is, is he
            a cat person?...</p>
