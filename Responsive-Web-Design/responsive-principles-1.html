    Media Queries are a new technique introduced in CSS3 that change the presentation of content based on different viewport sizes. 
    The viewport is a user's visible area of a web page, and is different depending on the device used to access the site.

    Media Queries consist of a media type, and if that media type matches the type of device the document is displayed on, 
    the styles are applied. You can have as many selectors and styles inside your media query as you want.

<style>
    p {
        font-size: 20px;
        width: 75vmin;
    }

    @media (max-height: 800px) {
        p {
            font-size: 10px;
        }
    }

    img {
        height: 100px;
        width: 100px;
    }

    h2 {
        width: 80vw;
    }
</style>


<!--
    Instead of using em or px to size text, you can use viewport units for responsive typography. 
    Viewport units, like percentages, are relative units, but they are based off different items. 
    Viewport units are relative to the viewport dimensions (width or height) of a device, and percentages are relative to the size of the parent container element.

    The four different viewport units are:

    vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
    vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
    vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
    vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width).
