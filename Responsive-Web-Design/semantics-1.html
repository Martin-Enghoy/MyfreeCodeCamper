<!--
    article is another one of the new HTML5 elements that add semantic meaning to your markup. 
    article is a sectioning element and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content. The tag works well with blog entries, forum posts, or news articles.

    Determining whether content can stand alone is usually a judgment call, but you can use a couple of simple tests. 
    Ask yourself if you removed all surrounding context, would that content still make sense? Similarly, for text, would the content hold up if it were in an RSS feed?

    Remember that folks using assistive technologies rely on organized, semantically meaningful markup to better understand your work.

    Note: The section element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly different semantic meaning than article. 
    An article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content. They can be used within each other, 
    as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a div.

    <div> - groups content <section> - groups related content <article> - groups independent, self-contained contentF

<body>
    <!-- 
        The next HTML5 element that adds semantic meaning and improves accessibility is the header tag. 
        It's used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages.

        header shares the embedded landmark feature you saw with main, allowing assistive technologies to quickly navigate to that content.
